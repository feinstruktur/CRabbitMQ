# CRabbitMQ

A swift package manager wrapper for rabbitmq-c

## Requirements

 - Swift package manager (SPM, see http://swift.org)
 - librabbitmq.dylib must be in `/usr/local/lib`. There is currently no other way to let SPM know where to find the library. Either copy the lib from this repository or install it via `brew install rabbitmq-c`
